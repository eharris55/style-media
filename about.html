      Styles Media started off as an idea. Our idea was to help companies grow their brand awareness through the utilization of social media. We wanted to change the world of digital marketing while also changing the negative view that people have of millennials. Our team is comprised of a group of friends that have made a living off of social media in the past. We were all hanging out one night and realized that with all of our phones combined, we had over 20 million followers in one room. This lead us to the conclusion that digital marketing is absolutely the future of business because we were essentially holding virtual billboards in our hands. Ever since that moment we have been working together to help many different companies grow their business through the power of modern technology.
